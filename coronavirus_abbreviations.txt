Bengali	NA	CORONAVIRUS & CO	corona	Corona in Bangla is homophonous with "Koro-na"   do-NEG. A joke on Facebook:  If you have a Bengali girlfriend and she says: "Corona". You will never know whether she meant the virus or was she asking you not to do (it). Not to do it here means not to be intimate. In both cases, you are expected to be physically distant.
